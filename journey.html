    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      While I donâ€™t have formal work experience yet in the field of web development,
      I previously worked as a Customer Service Representative in a call center environment.
      Through this experience, I developed strong communication, problem-solving, and multitasking skills,
      as well as a deeper understanding of technical systems and data security.
      Iâ€™ve been actively learning web development through school projects, online tutorials, and personal practice.
      I enjoy experimenting with code and continuously improving my skills by building small projects.
      Iâ€™m currently focused on enhancing my knowledge in frontend development and deepening my understanding of cybersecurity.
